//! Minimal interface traits for external contract composability (#71).
//!
//! These traits define the API surface that other Soroban contracts
//! (DEXes, lending protocols, yield aggregators) should depend on when
//! integrating with the Heliobond vault.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! External contracts should use `soroban_sdk::contractimport!` to import the
//! vault's WASM, which generates a typed client. These traits document the
//! expected interface and can be implemented by mock contracts in tests.
